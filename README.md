# hotel_bookings_analysis
The hospitality industry is a fiercely competitive landscape where hotels must stay ahead of the curve to ensure success. To do so, developing a deep understanding of customers' user journey is critical, which can be represented as a funnel from Awareness to Consideration to Conversion.

In this analysis, we will explore the three key areas of the funnel and identify the business problems that need to be solved to optimize each stage:
1. **Awareness** -> Can we forecast earnings to determine the budget for marketing campaigns? -> Allow the hotels to advertise to customers as a function of earnings. **[SARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting.]**
2. **Consideration** -> Who are the key customer segments? -> Enable the hotels to target specific groups of customers. **[Clustering with K-Prototypes.]**
3. **Conversion** -> Can we predict booking cancellations and identify the key features? -> Recommend actions in advance to mitigate booking cancellations. **[Logistic Regression as Base Model, AdaBoost, Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.]**
